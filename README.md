# p011-vgg16-oxfordiiitpet
VGG16 (CNN model) applied on OxfordIIIT Pet Dataset from scratch and through transfer learning; in both tensorflow and pytorch frameworks.
<!-- Finetuning and feature extraction were explored and performance was noted.  Effect of synthetic data (through augmentation techniques) was also observed. -->

# Result
Higher result eas achieved with transfer learning in pytorch implementation of VGG16 $\approx$ 85%. Here only last layer was trained while remaining model was kept froze. Tensorflow VGG transfer model did not have dropout layers and as our data is small so accuracy of $\approx$ 52% was achieved else it overfits. Training from scratch was not only time-consuming but due to small dataset is almost not feasible for large model like vgg16. Results can be seen in below [table](#vgg16-experimentation-summary)

# Dataset and Split
The Oxford-IIIT pet dataset is a 37 category pet image dataset with roughly 200 images for each class. Data has 7349 images of pets and is split into 85:15 train/test data respectively.
# Preprocessing
Images are normalized with dataset mean and std. Moreover, VGG16 was also trained on normalized IMAGENET data. 
# Data Augmentation
Data augmentation plays important part in training model especially when data is limited. Dataset size is increased by 6 fold via augmentation techniques in file [pytorch_data_augmentation](pytorch_data_augmentation.py) and [tf_data_augmentation](tf_data_augmentation.py). Original images are concatenated with central and corners crop. Central, top left, top right, bottom left, bottom left crops are additionally preprocessed by left_right_flip, random_hue, random_brightness, random_saturation, random_contrast; respectively. Moreover, corner crops are randomly left_right flipped using different seeds.
# VGG16 Architecture
VGG16 has 16 layers with learnable parameters; of which 13 are convolutional layers and 3 are fully connected layers.

Original VGG16 used 224 image size as input but we are using 128; due to which learnable parameters are reduced. Detailed diagram with output_shape after each layer and their parameters is:
